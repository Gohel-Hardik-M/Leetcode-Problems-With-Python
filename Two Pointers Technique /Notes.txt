The Two Pointers technique uses two indices to traverse a data structure (usually an array or string) in a coordinated way. It helps reduce time complexity by avoiding unnecessary nested loops. Common pointer movements include:

Moving from both ends toward the center

Moving one fast, one slow

Moving both forward at different speeds

Shrinking or expanding a window

When to Use Two Pointers
Use this technique when:

The input is sorted

You need to find pairs or triplets

You want to remove duplicates

You need to reverse, partition, or compare sequences

You want to detect cycles in linked lists

You want to solve subarray/substring problems efficiently

Common Patterns
1. Opposite Ends (Left + Right)
Used for:

Pair sum (Two Sum in sorted array)

Checking palindromes

Container With Most Water

Trapping Rain Water (variant)

Idea: Start with left = 0 and right = n - 1. Move pointers inward based on conditions.

2. Fast and Slow Pointers
Used for:

Cycle detection (Floyd’s algorithm)

Middle of linked list

Removing nth node from end

Detecting happy numbers

Idea: slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps.

3. Same Direction (Two Forward Pointers)
Used for:

Removing duplicates in sorted array

Partitioning arrays

Filtering elements

Idea: One pointer reads, the other writes.

4. Sliding Window (Two Pointers Variant)
Used for:

Longest substring without repeating characters

Minimum window substring

Fixed/variable window problems

Idea: left expands or shrinks the window while right moves forward.

# Time & Space Complexity
Time: Usually 
𝑂(𝑛)
 because each pointer moves at most n steps.

# Space: 
𝑂(1)
 — no extra data structures needed.
