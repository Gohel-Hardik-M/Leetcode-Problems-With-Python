# Leetcode-Problems-With-Python


This repository contains my personal solutions to **LeetCode problems**, organized by **patterns**.  
My goal is to master problem‑solving, understand common algorithmic patterns, and write clean, efficient Python code.

---

Each folder represents a **pattern**, and each file contains:
- ✅ Problem number  
- ✅ Clean Python solution  
- ✅ Time & space complexity  
- ✅ Explanation (if needed)

---

## 🧠 Why Patterns?

LeetCode problems repeat certain ideas.  
By grouping them into patterns, I can learn faster and recognize solutions instantly.

Some common patterns I’ll cover:
- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search  
- Fast & Slow Pointers  
- Linked List Patterns  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Backtracking  
- Hashing  
- Greedy Algorithms

## ✅ Goals of This Repository

- Build strong problem‑solving intuition  
- Practice clean, readable Python code  
- Track my progress  
- Create a reference for future interviews  
- Share knowledge with others
